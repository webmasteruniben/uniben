                                <h4>ESTABLISHMENT</h4>
                                <p>The University of Benin was founded on 23rd November, 1970 by the then Midwestern State Government initially as the Midwest Institute of Technology.  The Institute achieved full University status in July, 1971 after its recognition by the National Universities Commission and became the University of Benin.
                                </p> 
                                <p>The University of Benin has remained faithfully to its founding philosophy which is summed up in the motto “Knowledge for Service”.  Its original objective was to produce high-level human resources in Science and Technology, but this scope was expanded quite early, to include the Humanities, Social Sciences, Education and Law. Since then, the University has continued to grow and has virtually exploded in the rising number of Departments as well as the diversity of Academic Programmes.
                                </p>
